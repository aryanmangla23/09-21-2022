What I'm feeling tonight, I can't put it in words

I put up my fight to the best of me, you know the recipe

Won't know the rest of me, shit you ain't heard

You're feeling so dead to me, or so you should

This a vasectomy, rip to my energy, guess we weren't meant to be, or maybe we were

But these days I'm not feeling to sure

Like each way, my feelings get hurt

And don't be afraid but it's just getting worse

With every song and every verse, and every day when I think about you

Wanna kill myself, cuz I can't get all these demons out you

There's no how to manual, for this situation but I love myself

And that is tangible, for dissipation, separation but I'll fight like hell

I mean well, but just don't know what to do anymore

I go from remorse to my feet at your door in a second

I just don't get it, I got these questions shit I'm a mess and

I just don't know how you feel about me

I think that I do, but I always doubt me

I wish you would call me tell me <br>

<br> She called and she told me she loved it

But now I keep pushing her buttons

Twisting my heart and stomach, I plummet

Told her there's nobody else, baby just trust it it seems like she doesn't

And I just don't know what do, so many nights that I spent without you

Locked in this room

And now that you're here, I'm wishing that you just love me for me and the person I am

Been trying my best, and I'm never gonna blame if you don't understand

Correcting my steps when I make a mistake

In my life which is seemly frequent

I'm not even close to my peak yet, still fighting off demons that live without reason

Inside of my head, baby I wish I was dead sometimes

Can't count up the times on my fingers

I thought about ending my life with no meaning and then I found you

And I love you to death girl

It feels like we're dreaming with every breath that we make, and

These feelings are never gon' break, but

Baby I'm different, not even to close to a perfect man

But one things for sure is I will hold your hand until the end <br>

<br> Until the end, I'm working on being a better man

Emotions bend, and feelings change but that doesn't mean imma let em in

Or feel the pain, when I lose you again, but up until then

I'm in suspense, so I wait

I wish you would call me and tell me what's been on your plate

It's never too late to show me you love me
